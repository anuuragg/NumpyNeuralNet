# NumpyNeuralNet

This repository contains code for a simple machine learning model that uses linear regression along with a sigmoid activation function. The model is trained on a randomly generated dataset and is designed to classify data points. The training process involves gradient descent to optimize weights and biases, with cross-entropy loss guiding the updates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This code requires the following Python libraries:

* numpy
* pandas

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib.pyplot
```
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuuragg/NumpyNeuralNet.git
```
Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
